CA50 estimation using IMU data
Deep Learning based Diagnostics using Non-Intrusive Sensors | Python, LSTM, ResNet, IMU

• Custom built and trained a ResNet-LSTM deep learning network for predicting the quality of combustion in a UAV diesel engine.

• Achieved accurate detection of imperfect combustion cycles and estimation of the crank angle at 50% of the cumulative heat release (CA50) using IMU data with an accuracy of 1◦.
